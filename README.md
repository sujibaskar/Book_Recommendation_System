# Book Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis & Hybrid Deep Learning (3-Model Ensemble)

A sentiment-driven book recommendation system that classifies Amazon book reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments using an ensemble of three hybrid deep learning models.

---

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon book reviews using VADER for polarity scoring and BERT for contextual embeddings. Three hybrid deep learning models are trained and combined using a weighted soft voting ensemble for sentiment classification.

## Models Used

| Model               | Description                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| CNN-LSTM-GRU        | CNN for local features + LSTM + GRU for sequential learning |
| CNN-BiLSTM-GRU      | CNN + Bidirectional LSTM + GRU                              |
| LSTM-CNN            | LSTM for sequential + CNN for feature extraction            |

##  Dataset
- Source: Amazon Books Reviews (Kaggle)
- Size: 3,160 reviews (after cleaning)
- Balanced to: 4,716 samples via oversampling (1,572 per class)

##  Methodology
1. Preprocessing – Lowercasing, URL/special character removal, stopword removal, lemmatization
2. Sentiment Scoring – VADER compound polarity → Positive / Neutral / Negative labels
3. Oversampling – Random oversampling to balance class distribution
4. Feature Extraction – BERT (bert-base-uncased) 768-dim embeddings (96 tokens)
5. Feature Engineering – Normalized VADER polarity concatenated with BERT embeddings → (96, 769) input
6. Model Training – Three hybrid models trained with EarlyStopping
7. Ensemble – Weighted soft voting across all three models
8. Deployment – Streamlit web app exposed via Ngrok
